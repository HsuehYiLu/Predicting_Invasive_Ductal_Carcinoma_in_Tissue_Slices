Predicting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Tissue Slices using two pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect IDC in the tissue slice images

# Predicting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Tissue Slices

# This repository contains the code for the project "Predicting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Tissue Slices".
# The project uses two pre-trained convolutional neural networks to detect IDC in the tissue slice images.
# In order to avoid the overfitting issue and improve the model performance, two methods were implemented:
# data augmentation and learning rate search.

## Getting Started

# To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

# Python 3.6+
# PyTorch
# Torchvision
# NumPy
# Scikit-learn

# Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and run the following command to install the project dependencies:

# pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

# To train the models, you can run the following command:

# python train.py

# This will train the models and save the trained models to the `models` directory.

# To evaluate the models, you can run the following command:

# python evaluate.py

# This will evaluate the models on the test set and print the accuracy.

## Documentation

# The documentation for the project is available in the `docs` directory.
